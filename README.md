# langchain_agent

### Aim 
In this lesson we learn about uses of agent in langchain. Some applications require not just a predetermined chain of calls to LLMs/other tools, but potentially an unknown chain that depends on the userâ€™s input. In these types of chains, there is an agent which has access to a suite of tools. Depending on the user input, the agent can then decide which, if any, of these tools to call.<br/>
At the moment, there are two main types of agents:
- **Action Agents**: these agents decide the actions to take and execute that actions one action at a time.
- **Plan-and-Execute Agents**: these agents first decide a plan of actions to take, and then execute those actions one at a time.
